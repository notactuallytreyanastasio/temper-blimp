# be-elixir: a journal

A Temper backend for Elixir and the BEAM, written in the open. This directory
is the running record: one entry per working session, newest last, plus a
guide that grows as the backend does.

- [guide.md](guide.md) -- how the backend works as it stands: running it, what
  each Temper construct becomes in Elixir and why, and its limits.
- [probes/](probes/) -- the Elixir scripts every claim about the target was
  checked with. Run any of them with `elixir probes/<file>.exs`.
- [examples/](https://github.com/notactuallytreyanastasio/temper-blimp/tree/main/journal/examples) -- runnable Temper libraries with the Elixir that
  drives them, such as `bank/`, a set of `@actor` accounts.
