# Project Instructions
## Elixir Compilation Rules - CRITICAL
### TDD: Red-Green-Refactor is Mandatory

**ALWAYS write tests FIRST.** This is not optional.

The loop:

1. **Red** - Write a failing test that describes the behavior you want
2. **Green** - Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** - Clean up, extract, simplify. Tests still pass.
4. Repeat.

Rules:

- NEVER write implementation code without a test that exercises it
- Write the test BEFORE the implementation, not after
- Run `mix test` after every change. If tests fail, fix them before writing more code.
- If you are about to write a new function: write the test first
- If you are about to fix a bug: write a test that reproduces the bug first
- If you are about to refactor: make sure tests pass before AND after
- Test the pure functional core thoroughly (parsers, state machines, transformations)
- LiveView tests are integration tests, write them after the unit tests pass

### Compilation: Zero Tolerance for Warnings

**ALL Elixir compilation MUST use `--warnings-as-errors`.**

- Always run `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` after editing Elixir files
- If a warning appears in ANY tool output, fix it immediately before doing anything else
- This includes: unused variables, unused aliases, missing specs, deprecated functions
- The PostToolUse hook `elixir-compile-check.sh` will block you if warnings are detected
- Do not proceed past a warning. Fix it first.

### Elixir Style Rules - CRITICAL

**HEEx templates:**

- NEVER use `<%= if ... do %>` / `<%= for ... do %>` -- use `:if={condition}` and `:for={item <- list}` attributes instead
- NEVER use `<%= expression %>` for simple interpolation -- use `{expression}` curly brace syntax
- The `<%= %>` tag is only for rare cases where attribute syntax genuinely can't work

**Code structure:**

- NEVER nest `if` inside `case` or vice versa -- break into separate multi-clause functions instead
- NEVER use `Process.sleep` in tests -- use `assert_receive` with message passing for async coordination
- One struct/type per file -- no `defmodule Foo do defmodule Bar` nesting for data types
- Keep `alias` groups alphabetically sorted within each group
- Group all `def handle_event` (or any same-name function) clauses together -- don't interleave private helpers between them

**Data modeling:**

- Use embedded Ecto schemas for state machines and typed structs (gives you Ecto.Enum, changesets)
- Use tagged tuples for signals/actions (e.g. `{:stage_file, path}`) not separate boolean/string fields

**Supervision:**

- Don't use `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink` for fire-and-forget work -- use `start_child` with explicit `send` back to the caller and `Process.monitor` for crash detection
- Capture `self()` in a variable BEFORE passing to closures -- `self()` inside `fn -> ... end` evaluates to the spawned process, not the caller

**JSON in tests:**

- Use `Jason.encode!(%{...})` with formatted Elixir maps for test fixtures, not raw `~s|{...}|` strings

### Quality Checklist (run before considering anything "done")

```bash
mix compile --warnings-as-errors  # zero warnings
mix test                          # all green
mix credo --strict                # no issues
mix format --check-formatted      # properly formatted
```

## Decision Graph Workflow

**THIS IS MANDATORY. Log decisions IN REAL-TIME, not retroactively.**

## Git Branching Rules - CRITICAL

**One branch per major concept.** Always work on a feature branch, never directly on main.

### Branch naming convention

```
<chunk>/<feature-slug>
```

Examples:

- `blimp-core/parser-basics` - first parser for the language
- `blimp-core/actor-runtime` - actor runtime implementation
- `blog/second-post` - second blog entry
- `infra/deploy-ci` - CI/deployment work

### Workflow

1. Create a branch BEFORE starting work: `git checkout -b <chunk>/<slug>`
2. Commit in small logical chunks on the branch
3. When the feature is complete, push and open a PR: `git push -u origin <branch> && gh pr create`
4. PR into main after review
5. Delete the branch after merge

### Rules

- NEVER commit directly to main during active development
- Each branch should represent ONE coherent feature or fix
- Deciduous nodes are auto-tagged with the current branch

### FAILURE MODE: Batch Backfilling

If you ever find yourself needing to "catch up" on deciduous logging, you have ALREADY FAILED. The graph is useless if it's written after the fact because it captures what you _remember_ doing, not what you _actually_ did. The whole point is real-time capture.

**How this failure happens:**

- You get excited about implementation and start writing code without logging
- You tell yourself "I'll log it after this one thing" and then forget
- You batch 10 actions into one big logging session

**How to prevent it:**

- BEFORE every Edit/Write: have you logged an action node? The hook will block you if not.
- BEFORE every new feature: have you logged a goal node? Do it FIRST.
- AFTER every outcome (test pass, compile success, deploy): log it IMMEDIATELY, don't do the next thing first.
- If you are about to write MORE than 3 lines of code: STOP. Log the action. Then write.
- If the user asks for a new feature: log the goal BEFORE you even think about implementation.
- When you create a node: link it to its parent IN THE SAME COMMAND SEQUENCE. Not later.

**Self-check every 5 tool calls:**

- When was my last deciduous node? If more than 5 tool calls ago, something is wrong.
- Am I in the middle of implementation with no action node? Stop and log.
- Did something just succeed or fail? Log the outcome NOW.

### The Node Flow Rule - CRITICAL

The canonical flow through the decision graph is:

```
goal -> options -> decision -> actions -> outcomes
```

- **Goals** lead to **options** (possible approaches to explore)
- **Options** lead to a **decision** (choosing which option to pursue)
- **Decisions** lead to **actions** (implementing the chosen approach)
- **Actions** lead to **outcomes** (results of the implementation)
- **Observations** attach anywhere relevant
- Goals do NOT lead directly to decisions -- there must be options first
- Options do NOT come after decisions -- options come BEFORE decisions
- Decision nodes should only be created when an option is actually chosen, not prematurely

### The Core Rule

```
BEFORE you do something -> Log what you're ABOUT to do
AFTER it succeeds/fails -> Log the outcome
CONNECT immediately -> Link every node to its parent
AUDIT regularly -> Check for missing connections
```

### Behavioral Triggers - MUST LOG WHEN:

| Trigger                       | Log Type           | Example                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| User asks for a new feature   | `goal` **with -p** | "Add dark mode"                |
| Exploring possible approaches | `option`           | "Use Redux for state"          |
| Choosing between approaches   | `decision`         | "Choose state management"      |
| About to write/edit code      | `action`           | "Implementing Redux store"     |
| Something worked or failed    | `outcome`          | "Redux integration successful" |
| Notice something interesting  | `observation`      | "Existing code uses hooks"     |

### Document Attachments

Attach files (images, PDFs, diagrams, specs, screenshots) to decision graph nodes for rich context.

```bash
# Attach a file to a node
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path>
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path> -d "Architecture diagram"
deciduous doc attach <node_id> <file_path> --ai-describe

# List documents
deciduous doc list              # All documents
deciduous doc list <node_id>    # Documents for a specific node

# Manage documents
deciduous doc show <doc_id>     # Show document details
deciduous doc describe <doc_id> "Updated description"
deciduous doc describe <doc_id> --ai   # AI-generate description
deciduous doc open <doc_id>     # Open in default application
deciduous doc detach <doc_id>   # Soft-delete (recoverable)
deciduous doc gc                # Remove orphaned files from disk
```

**When to suggest document attachment:**

| Situation                               | Action                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User shares an image or screenshot      | Ask: "Want me to attach this to the current goal/action node?" |
| User references an external document    | Ask: "Should I attach a copy to the decision graph?"           |
| Architecture diagram is discussed       | Suggest attaching it to the relevant goal node                 |
| Files not in the project are dropped in | Attach to the most relevant active node                        |

**Do NOT aggressively prompt for documents.** Only suggest when files are directly relevant to a decision node. Files are stored in `.deciduous/documents/` with content-hash naming for deduplication.

### CRITICAL: Capture VERBATIM User Prompts

**Prompts must be the EXACT user message, not a summary.** When a user request triggers new work, capture their full message word-for-word.

**BAD - summaries are useless for context recovery:**

```bash
# DON'T DO THIS - this is a summary, not a prompt
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -p "User asked: add login to the app"
```

**GOOD - verbatim prompts enable full context recovery:**

```bash
# Use --prompt-stdin for multi-line prompts
deciduous add goal "Add auth" -c 90 --prompt-stdin << 'EOF'
I need to add user authentication to the app. Users should be able to sign up
with email/password, and we need OAuth support for Google and GitHub. The auth
should use JWT tokens with refresh token rotation.
EOF

# Or use the prompt command to update existing nodes
deciduous prompt 42 << 'EOF'
The full verbatim user message goes here...
EOF
```

**When to capture prompts:**

- Root `goal` nodes: YES - the FULL original request
- Major direction changes: YES - when user redirects the work
- Routine downstream nodes: NO - they inherit context via edges

**Updating prompts on existing nodes:**

```bash
deciduous prompt <node_id> "full verbatim prompt here"
cat prompt.txt | deciduous prompt <node_id>  # Multi-line from stdin
```

Prompts are viewable in the web viewer.

### CRITICAL: Maintain Connections

**The graph's value is in its CONNECTIONS, not just nodes.**

| When you create... | IMMEDIATELY link to...                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `outcome`          | The action that produced it             |
| `action`           | The decision that spawned it            |
| `decision`         | The option(s) it chose between          |
| `option`           | Its parent goal                         |
| `observation`      | Related goal/action                     |
| `revisit`          | The decision/outcome being reconsidered |

**Root `goal` nodes are the ONLY valid orphans.**

### Quick Commands

```bash
deciduous add goal "Title" -c 90 -p "User's original request"
deciduous add action "Title" -c 85
deciduous link FROM TO -r "reason"  # DO THIS IMMEDIATELY!
deciduous serve   # View live (auto-refreshes every 30s)
deciduous sync    # Export for static hosting

# Metadata flags
# -c, --confidence 0-100   Confidence level
# -p, --prompt "..."       Store the user prompt (use when semantically meaningful)
# -f, --files "a.rs,b.rs"  Associate files
# -b, --branch <name>      Git branch (auto-detected)
# --commit <hash|HEAD>     Link to git commit (use HEAD for current commit)
# --date "YYYY-MM-DD"      Backdate node (for archaeology)

# Branch filtering
deciduous nodes --branch main
deciduous nodes -b feature-auth
```

### CRITICAL: Link Commits to Actions/Outcomes

**After every git commit, link it to the decision graph!**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add auth"
deciduous add action "Implemented auth" -c 90 --commit HEAD
deciduous link <goal_id> <action_id> -r "Implementation"
```

The `--commit HEAD` flag captures the commit hash and links it to the node. The web viewer will show commit messages, authors, and dates.

### Git History & Deployment

```bash
# Export graph AND git history for web viewer
deciduous sync

# This creates:
# - docs/graph-data.json (decision graph)
# - docs/git-history.json (commit info for linked nodes)
```

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. `deciduous sync` to export
2. Push to GitHub
3. Settings > Pages > Deploy from branch > /docs folder

Your graph will be live at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`

### Branch-Based Grouping

Nodes are auto-tagged with the current git branch. Configure in `.deciduous/config.toml`:

```toml
[branch]
main_branches = ["main", "master"]
auto_detect = true
```

### Audit Checklist (Before Every Sync)

1. Does every **outcome** link back to what caused it?
2. Does every **action** link to why you did it?
3. Any **dangling outcomes** without parents?

### Git Staging Rules - CRITICAL

**NEVER use broad git add commands that stage everything:**

- ❌ `git add -A` - stages ALL changes including untracked files
- ❌ `git add .` - stages everything in current directory
- ❌ `git add -a` or `git commit -am` - auto-stages all tracked changes
- ❌ `git add *` - glob patterns can catch unintended files

**ALWAYS stage files explicitly by name:**

- ✅ `git add src/main.rs src/lib.rs`
- ✅ `git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock`
- ✅ `git add .claude/commands/decision.md`

**Why this matters:**

- Prevents accidentally committing sensitive files (.env, credentials)
- Prevents committing large binaries or build artifacts
- Forces you to review exactly what you're committing
- Catches unintended changes before they enter git history

### Session Start Checklist

```bash
deciduous check-update    # Update needed? Run 'deciduous update' if yes
                          # (auto-checked every 24h if auto-update is on)
deciduous nodes           # What decisions exist?
deciduous edges           # How are they connected? Any gaps?
deciduous doc list        # Any attached documents to review?
git status                # Current state
```

### Multi-User Sync

Sync decisions with teammates via event logs:

```bash
# Check sync status
deciduous events status

# Apply teammate events (after git pull)
deciduous events rebuild

# Compact old events periodically
deciduous events checkpoint --clear-events
```

Events auto-emit on add/link/status commands. Git merges event files automatically.
