# Build Tetris in Blimp

Ten chapters that build the Tetris running on [bobbby.online/tetris](https://bobbby.online/tetris), one actor at a time, and an eleventh that builds a page of forms and lists: a guestbook. Each chapter has an exercise: a Blimp file with some handlers left as `reply :TODO`, and the tests that say when they are right. Chapter 8 plays the game you wrote, and chapter 10 the guestbook.

Read it at [blimp.bobbby.online/tutorial/](https://blimp.bobbby.online/tutorial/). The page runs the interpreter as WebAssembly, so the editor, the tests and the game all run in the browser.

## Running an exercise locally

Build the interpreter (`cd chunks/lang && zig build`), then:

```
$ chunks/lang/zig-out/bin/blimp exercises/ch01_piece/01_piece.blimp --test
```

Fill in the handlers marked `# Exercise:`, save, run again. The answers are in each chapter's `solutions/` directory.

## Where the exercises come from

The finished game is [`chunks/lang/examples/tetris.blimp`](../../chunks/lang/examples/tetris.blimp), and the exercises are cut from it: each file carries what earlier chapters built, finished, and then the chapter's own actor with its tests. Most of the tests are the game's own. A few are new, for things only one chapter can check, like the wall kick in chapter 6 and a line clear through the whole game in chapter 7.

Earlier chapters' actors come first in every file. That is not tidiness: defining an actor runs its state defaults, and `state shapes: Tetris.Shapes :: spawn Tetris.Shapes` fails if `Tetris.Shapes` is defined further down.
