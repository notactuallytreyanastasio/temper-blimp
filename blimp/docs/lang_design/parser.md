# Blimp Parser: Design Questions & Answers

> This is a living document. Every decision we make about the parser gets recorded here so we can see the design evolve.

## What are we building?

A parser for Blimp -- a language with actors, pattern matching, and agent integration. We're building two things in parallel:

1. **A tree-sitter grammar** (`tree-sitter-blimp/`) -- gives us incremental parsing, syntax highlighting, structured queries for agents, and LSP foundations
2. **A Zig parser** (`src/`) -- the "real" compiler frontend that will eventually emit LLVM IR

Both define the same syntax and evolve together.

## Why Zig?

- Simple, readable systems language -- good for learning compiler internals
- Built on LLVM (Zig's own backend), so we're already in that ecosystem
- Explicit memory management -- no hidden allocations, we control everything
- Comptime metaprogramming -- useful for parser tables and token dispatch
- C interop is trivial -- important when we need LLVM C API for codegen
- No garbage collector -- the parser allocates into an arena and frees it all at once

## Why tree-sitter alongside the Zig parser?

The agents in Blimp need to *understand* code structurally, not just as text. Tree-sitter gives us:

- **Incremental parsing** -- only re-parse what changed, critical for the REPL where code is constantly in flux
- **Structured queries** -- agents can ask "find all actors", "what messages does this actor handle?", "what's in scope here?"
- **Syntax highlighting** -- works in any editor that supports tree-sitter (neovim, helix, zed, VS Code with extensions)
- **LSP foundation** -- go-to-definition, hover, completions all build on the tree-sitter AST
- **Error recovery** -- tree-sitter keeps parsing even when syntax is broken, essential for a live REPL

## Why recursive descent (for the Zig parser)?

- Easiest to understand and debug -- you can step through with a debugger
- Gives us full control over error messages ("expected 'do' after actor name, got ';'")
- Pratt parsing for expression precedence -- clean, composable
- No external dependencies (no parser generator, no grammar file to compile)
- The tree-sitter grammar handles the "incremental/error-tolerant" side, so the Zig parser can be strict

## Decisions Made

### D1: Syntax scope for first pass (2024-03-20)

**Scope: "Small -- actors + expressions"**

What's in:
- `actor Name do ... end`
- `state key: value, key: value`
- `on :message(args) do ... end`
- `become key: value, ...`
- `reply expression`
- Literals: integers, floats, strings, atoms, booleans, nil
- Variables / identifiers
- Binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Maps: `%{key: value}`
- Lists: `[a, b, c]`
- Tuples: `{a, b}`
- Function calls: `foo(args)`

What's NOT in yet:
- Pipe operator `|>` and `_` placeholder
- Message send `<-`
- Pattern matching in `on` handlers (just simple variable binding)
- Guards (`when`)
- Supervisor syntax
- Module/import system
- Type annotations
- `def` for plain functions

### D2: Tree-sitter and Zig parser built in parallel (2024-03-20)

Both evolve together. Tree-sitter is the canonical grammar for tooling. Zig parser is the compiler frontend. They define the same syntax.

### D3: Perceus reference counting for runtime memory management (2024-03-20)

No garbage collector. Blimp will use Perceus-style reference counting (Reinking et al.). This is a compile-time insertion of reference counting operations that achieves:

- Deterministic deallocation (no GC pauses)
- Optimal reuse -- when a ref count drops to 1, the compiler can reuse the memory in-place instead of allocating new
- Works perfectly with immutable data and `become` semantics -- each `become` creates a new state snapshot, Perceus ensures the old one is freed when no longer referenced
- Aligns with the actor model -- each actor's state is isolated, so reference counting is local (no cross-actor GC coordination)

This is a RUNTIME decision, not a parser decision, but it fundamentally shapes how the compiler will eventually transform the AST. The parser itself uses Zig's arena allocator (allocate during parse, free everything at once).

### D4: State declarations with required types (2026-03-21)

State fields use `state name: Type :: default_value` syntax:

```
state count: Int :: 0
state items: [Item] :: []
state name: String :: "unknown"
state rates: %{Atom => Float} :: %{us: 0.08, eu: 0.21}
```

- `:` separates the field name from its type
- `::` separates the type from the default value
- Types are required (not optional). Set-theoretic types with inference where possible.
- `[Item]` for list types, `%{K => V}` for map types

### D5: Hole (`_`) is a first-class language construct (2026-03-21)

`_` creates a Hole. A Hole is NOT a discard/wildcard like in Elixir or Haskell. It is:

- **An agent-hole**: a typed gap the agent sees and suggests completions for
- **Identity at runtime**: until filled, a Hole acts as identity so the program keeps running
- **Tracked by the compiler**: the compiler knows where every Hole is and what type it needs
- **Rendered on the canvas**: finished code is solid/geometric, Holes are chaotic/noisy
- **Context-sensitive**: inside a pipe `|>`, the Hole is filled by the piped value. Elsewhere, it's an agent Hole.

Comments after a Hole are **directives to the agent**, not descriptions:
```
_ # Hole: handle invalid payment, begin by researching documentation on transaction failure
```

The comment IS the prompt. The agent reads it, does the research, comes back with suggestions.

### D6: `situation` keyword for ambiguity-aware branching (2026-03-21)

`situation` is like `case` but with a key difference: a `case` must be exhaustive. A `situation` can have Holes and that's valid. The agent participates in resolving ambiguity.

```
on :process(event: Event) do
  situation event do
    :login -> handle_login(event)
    :logout -> handle_logout(event)
    _ # Hole: agent suggests :timeout, :error based on Event type
  end
end
```

### D7: `bubble` for supervision/failure with Bubbles as actors (2026-03-21)

Failure handling uses `bubble`. Bubbles are themselves actors that propagate through the supervision tree. Different Bubble actors implement different blast radii:

- `SelfBubble` -- I die, my supervisor restarts me
- `CascadeBubble` -- I die and take my siblings with me (one-for-all)
- `FatalBubble` -- kill the entire subtree

Declared per-handler, not per-actor:
```
on :charge(payment: Payment) bubbles(CascadeBubble) do
  ...
  _ -> bubble reason: "payment failed"
end
```

Inspired by Temper's Bubble model (bubble() signals failure, orelse recovers, type system tracks it) but adapted for actor supervision. `orelse` handles bubbles on the caller side:
```
receipt = checkout <- :charge(payment) orelse bubble
```

### D8: No shared memory -- actors are fully isolated (2026-03-21)

Each actor owns its state exclusively. Communication is message-passing only. Messages are copied across actor boundaries. This enables:

- Arena-per-actor memory (free everything when actor dies)
- No locks, no mutexes, no data races
- Perceus RC is local per actor, no cross-actor coordination
- Aligns with BEAM spirit without requiring the Erlang VM

### D9: Everything is an actor (2026-03-21)

There is no separate concept of "pure functions" or "helper modules." Everything is an actor. Some actors hold state and handle many messages. Some are tiny and do one thing. A helper function is just an actor with one handler that replies immediately.

`System` is the root actor that provides primitives (math, IO, strings). You're always inside System.

### D10: `case` keyword for exhaustive pattern matching (2026-03-21)

`case` is the strict counterpart to `situation`. Same syntax, different semantics:
- `case` demands exhaustiveness -- every branch must be covered, compiler proves it
- `situation` permits ambiguity -- branches can have Holes that agents fill

```
case color do
  :red -> become color: :green
  :green -> become color: :yellow
  :yellow -> become color: :red
end
```

Separate `case_expr` AST node (same shape as `Situation` but distinct tag). Exhaustiveness checking is a future type checker pass.

### D11: Explicit types everywhere -- no inference, no gradual typing (2026-03-21)

**Types are mandatory.** Every handler parameter must declare its type. Every handler can declare a return type. Every state field must declare its type.

```
on :charge(payment: Payment) -> {Atom, Int} when payment > 0 bubbles(CascadeBubble) do
  ...
end
```

The syntax order is: `on :name(params) -> ReturnType when guard bubbles(Strategy) do`

This is a deliberate choice -- not inference, not gradual. The contracts are what the REPL displays, what agents read, what the checker enforces, and what time-travel annotates. Every character of type annotation does quadruple duty.

Type syntax supports:
- Primitives: `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Bool`, `Atom`, `Any`
- Lists: `[Item]`, `[Int]`
- Tuples: `{Atom, Int}`, `{String, [Item]}`
- Maps: `%{String => Int}`, `%{Atom => Any}`
- Actor references: any `UpperCase` name

### D12: Type checker -- first pass (2026-03-21)

The type checker (`checker.zig`) walks the AST and validates:
- State default values match declared types
- `become` field values match declared state types
- Handler parameters are typed (error if missing annotation)
- `reply` values match declared return types
- Binary/unary operations have compatible operand types
- Int promotes to Float, nil is subtype of list/map/actor

**Known limitation:** The checker cannot verify that a map literal `%{name: "x"}` satisfies a named actor type like `Message`. This requires type aliases or struct definitions -- a future addition. Until then, `Any` is the escape hatch for unverifiable structural-vs-nominal mismatches.

## Open Questions

### Q1: How do atoms work syntactically?

Atoms are `:name`. But message patterns are `:name(args)`. Is `:name(args)` an atom with arguments, or is it a special "message pattern" syntax?

**Current thinking:** `:name` is an atom literal. `:name(args)` in `on` handlers is a message pattern -- syntactically different from a bare atom. The parser treats `on :name(args)` as a handler with a message name and argument list, not as an expression.

### Q2: Newlines as statement separators?

Do we require newlines between statements (like Ruby/Python), or use explicit semicolons (like C/Zig), or make them optional?

**Current thinking:** Newlines are statement separators, like Ruby. Semicolons are optional alternatives. Inside `do...end` blocks, each line is a statement. This feels natural given the Ruby-flavored surface syntax.

### Q3: How does `become` parse?

`become` takes keyword arguments: `become key: value, key: value`. This looks like a function call with keyword args, but it's a special form -- it replaces the actor's entire state.

**Current thinking:** `become` is a keyword, not a function. It takes a comma-separated list of `identifier: expression` pairs. The parser has a special rule for it.

### Q4: What's the precedence of operators?

For the first pass, standard math precedence:
1. `!` (unary not)
2. `*`, `/` (multiplicative)
3. `+`, `-` (additive)
4. `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (comparison)
5. `&&` (logical and)
6. `||` (logical or)
7. `=` (assignment, lowest)

### Q5: How do we handle `cons` in lists?

`[item | items]` uses `|` as a cons operator inside list literals. This is Elixir-style head|tail syntax. The parser needs to handle `|` specially inside `[...]`.

### Q6: Dot access for maps/structs?

`item.price` is dot access. Is this just syntactic sugar for `item[:price]`? Or a distinct operation?

**Current thinking:** Dot access is its own AST node. It's the primary way to access fields. Bracket access `item[:price]` is separate and works on maps. Both parse as postfix operators.

### Q7: Type aliases / struct definitions?

The checker can verify `{:ok, 42}` matches `{Atom, Int}` structurally. But it cannot verify that `%{name: "x", hp: 100}` matches a named type like `Character`. We need either:

- **Type aliases:** `type Receipt = {Atom, Int}` -- pure structural synonyms
- **Struct definitions:** actors implicitly define a struct type from their state fields, so `Character` means `%{name: String, hp: Int, ...}`
- **Both:** aliases for ad-hoc types, struct projection for actor types

This is the next major type system decision. It determines whether the type checker can close the gap between map literals and named types without `Any` escape hatches.

### Q8: Should map keys be atoms or strings?

Map literal shorthand `%{name: "x"}` produces atom keys (`:name`). But `%{String => Any}` declares string keys. These don't match. Options:

- Shorthand `name:` always produces Atom keys (current behavior) -- declared map types should use `%{Atom => V}`
- Shorthand `name:` produces String keys -- more compatible with JSON-style data
- Both forms: `name:` for atom keys, `"name":` for string keys

## Architecture Notes

### Token types

See `src/token.zig` for the full list. Highlights:
- Keywords are identified by table lookup after lexing an identifier
- Atoms start with `:` followed by an identifier
- Two-character operators (`|>`, `<-`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) need one character of lookahead

### AST shape

See `src/ast.zig` for the full type. The AST is a tagged union -- each node variant carries its own data. Source locations are tracked on every node for error reporting.

### Memory strategy

The parser uses an arena allocator. All AST nodes are allocated from the arena. When we're done with the AST (after codegen or analysis), we free the entire arena at once. No individual frees, no reference counting, no GC.
